This video features an approach for connecting the Eclipse SUMO track simulation with the open source connected vehicle ecosystem Eclipse Kuksa. More precisely, Eclipse SUMO is used to simulate traffic scenarios including microscopic properties like the position or emission. The generated data of each vehicle is then be sent to the message gateway of the Kuksa IoT Cloud platform and delegated to an according example service that consumes the data. 

In this way, not only the scalability of connected vehicle IoT architectures can be tested based on real world scenarios, but also the functionality of cloud services can be ensured by providing context-specific automotive data that goes beyond rudimentary or fake data-sets.
